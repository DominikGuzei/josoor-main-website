In 2015, the idea of Josoor was born. Since then, a changing team of people, both refugees and 
locals, has been working on different stages of implementation.
 
In the process, we encountered several problems that we first had to overcome. We hit 
roadblocks and had setbacks. After a period of reassessment, we decided to restructure 
and dive right into it again. And now we are finally able to say: we are starting to test 
our first product: Josoor Answers!
 
Josoor Answers will be the promised “information guide” – but better. Instead of just a 
collection of information, it will be an instant question and answer network that 
simultaneously saves all the information exchanged among the users into a coherent 
database easily accessible for both refugees and local supporters.
 
“Ask- Answer-Translate” is its slogan as that’s exactly what it enables you to do: ask 
the questions you don’t know the answers to, share your knowledge with the rest of the 
community by answering other member’s questions, and translate knowledge from one 
language to another!
 
Josoor Answers will not only be a forever growing, organised database for all information 
relevant to refugees and those supporting them. More than that, refugees and locals 
will finally be able to breach the language barrier in exchanging information by 
enabling those that speak two languages to easily translate relevant content and thus 
provide their skills for the benefit of the whole community.  
 
We hope to thereby enable refugees to put their time to good use and give them better 
access to information than before while reducing the workload on supporters with 
translating information and simultaneously jointly build the largest information 
database for anybody involved in the “refugee crisis”.
 
Each and every person is an expert in something, and with Josoor, everyone can 
contribute their expertise to the benefit of the whole.
 
Our Team is still working on developing and testing Josoor Answers – but in a short 
time, we will open Beta testing for a limited number of users.
