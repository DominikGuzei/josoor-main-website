For more than two years, our team has been working on the idea of Josoor: an online platform connecting refugees & local supporters worldwide, providing them with different tools to solve the many challenges they face. 

A year ago, after founding the association of Josoor, recruiting the right team members and breaking down the idea into smaller pieces to implement step by step, we started working on the first one of these tools: the app we now call [Josoor Answers](https://www.josoor.net/en/blog/posts/josoor-answers). With it, we want to enable refugees and local supporters worldwide to bridge the language barrier in information exchange. Since then, we tested the idea, decided on all its features, built the wireframes, and gave it a design.

Now, our Team is ready to start the development - but we need money to make it happen!

35.000 € are required to fund the development of Josoor Answers and it’s Beta test and bring it all the way to the public launch. 

## Why Crowdfunding?

We thought long about the different possibilities to raise funds, weighing all the pros and cons of each, and in the end decided to run a crowdfunding campaign. 

The reason for this decision can be summed up with ownership: we started as a grassroot organisation and we want to stay that way. Allowing public funds or large individual private donations to finance the lion's share of the App’s development could lead to restrictions, limitations or conflicts. Since we want our community members to be a part of Josoor just as much as we are ourselves, we ask all of you to fund its creation to assure that all power stays within the community itself.

To thank you for your help in building Josoor Answers, we have prepared several great perks with a message - all of them limited to this crowdfunding campaign and only available until it ends!

## How can I support the campaign?

* Donate - even the smallest amount!\
  As a grassroot organisation, we rely not on individual large donations, but on many small and even tiny contributions each community member can afford! If all of our currently 30.000 followers would donate just 1 Euro and 33 Cents, we would meet our goal right now!
* Spread the word!\
  Even more important than contributing financially is to help us reach as many people as possible. Crowdfunding campaigns thrive when they get shared - so help us and tell all your friends about it!
