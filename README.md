# Josoor Main Website

This is the open source respository for the main website of Josoor.

_Josoor is a non-profit organisation developing tools to enable refugees & local 
supporters to connect, exchange and help each other out._

# How to Contribute

This website is based on the [phenomic](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic) 
static site generator and you can easily run the development version locally.

([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) must be installed on your system)

## Install Node Dependencies
```
npm install
```

## Run in Development Mode

```
npm run dev
```

then open the website on http://localhost:3333/

## Preview Production Build

```
npm run preview
```

then open the website on http://localhost:3333/

## Build for Production

```
npm run build
```

The output will be put into the `dist` directory.

## Git Workflow

We are using [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for
collaboration over Github.

All branches and pull requests on Github are automatically built and available as live previews
on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/).
