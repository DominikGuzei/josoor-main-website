However, in all those currently available, they remain in two separated groups due to the language barrier, while the knowledge that is being exchanged within those two groups is mostly badly organised and oftentimes lost altogether.<br><br>We spent lots of time searching for a tool that enables all those involved in the “refugee crisis” to exchange knowledge beyond language barriers and simultaneously collect and manage the information efficiently. We couldn’t find any - so we decided to build it ourselves.</p>",
